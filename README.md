Hi Guys!
This is MindStory Project by Team Conserfate. Deployed on https://mindstory.apps.tas.cnasg.dellcsc.com/. Live chat page and image of story creation page unable to work, sorry for the inconvenience! :') 

Instructions:
1. We recommend you to open our project on VSCode, not PyCharm. When we tried running our web application on PyCharm, some of our images are not showing, because sometimes the OS module on PyCharm is not working.

2. After opening our project folder, you have to install the virtual environment with this command," pip install -r requirements.txt", to install the libraries we used for this project.

3. Run the app/routes.py python script to start our web application.

4. For the Story Creation page, when you try to create a story, please choose an image from the "static" folder, otherwise our web application could not render the image.

5. You can access the Admin page via the footer, the password is "fumo".

6. When you try to delete accounts on the Admin page, please also follow the instructions there, which is to also delete the account in Firebase authentication. The link to Firebase will be made available there.

7. Thank you and we hope you will enjoy testing our web application! :)
